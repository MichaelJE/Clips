    <h2>Release Notes</h2>

    <p>The release notes help section contains information about new features and where to get technical support.</p>

    <h3>New Features</h3>

    <p>Version 6.2 of CLIPS contains two major enhancements. First, CLIPS now provides a mechanism which allows an
    embedded application to create multiple environments into which programs can be loaded. Second, an improved Windows
    2000/XP CLIPS interface is now available and the Macintosh CLIPS interface has been enhanced to support MacOS X.
    For a detailed listing of differences between the 6.x releases, refer to appendix B of the <i>Basic Programming
    Guide</i> and appendix C of the <i>Advanced Programming Guide</i>.</p>

    <h3>Support Information</h3>

    <p>CLIPS executables, documentation, and source code are available for download from <a href=
    "http://www.ghg.net/clips/download/">http://www.ghg.net/clips/download/</a>.</p>

    <p>Questions regarding CLIPS can be sent via electronic mail to clipsYYYY@ghg.net where YYYY is the current year
    (for example, 2006). Include the words 'CLIPS USER' in the subject line.</p>

    <p>An electronic conferencing facility, sponsored by Distributed Computing Systems (<a href=
    "http://www.discomsys.com">http://www.discomsys.com</a>), is also available to CLIPS users. Subscribers to this
    facility may send questions, observations, answers, editorials, etc., in the form of electronic mail to the
    conference. All subscribers will have a copy of these messages reflected back to them at their respective
    electronic mail addresses. To subscribe, send a single line message to clips-request@discomsys.com containing the
    word "subscribe". The subject field is ignored but the address found in the 'Reply:', 'Reply to:', or 'From:' field
    will be entered in the distribution list. Upon subscription you will receive a mail message instructing you how to
    participate in the conference from that point forward. Save this mail message. You may need the instructions later
    if you wish to unsubscribe from the list server.</p>

    <p>To send your own messages to members of the conference you need simply address your mail to clips@discomsys.com.
    Your message will be reflected to all other members of the conference.</p>

    <p>If you wish to remove yourself from the conference and discontinue receiving mail simply send a message to
    clips-request@discomsys.com with "unsubscribe" as the message text. If you want to unsubscribe using another email
    account than the one you subscribed with, then append the original subscribing email account to the text of the
    message. For example: "unsubscribe john.doe@account.net". Do not send unsubscribe messages to clips@discomsys.com!
    This sends a mail message to every member of the list. If you need to get in contact with the list administrator
    (for trouble unsubscribing or other questions about the list), send email to clips-owner @discomsys.com.</p>

    <p>A CLIPS World Wide Web page can be accessed using the URL <a href=
    "http://www.ghg.net/clips/CLIPS.html">http://www.ghg.net/clips/CLIPS.html</a>.</p>

    <p>Usenet users can also find information and post questions about CLIPS to the comp.ai.shells news group.</p>

    <p>The CLIPS Developers' Forum, a thread-based message board, is available at <a href=
    "http://www.cpbinc.com/clips">http://www.cpbinc.com/clips</a>. This board exists to provide a site for discussion
    of research, development, and implementation of the CLIPS expert systems and related technologies. The hosting
    services for this web page are provided by CPB, Inc. Questions pertaining to this forum can be sent to
    clips@cpbinc.com.</p>

        do-for-all-facts, and delayed-do-for-all-facts. The GetNextFactInTemplate function (see section 4.4.17 of the

    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Bug Fixes</b> - The following bugs were fixed by the 6.23 release:</li>

            <ul>
                <li>A large file name (at least 60 characters) passed into the fetch command causes a buffer
                overrun.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>A large module or construct name (at least 500 characters) causes a buffer overrun when the

            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>The FalseSymbol and TrueSymbol constants were not defined as described in the <i>Advanced
                Programming Guide</i>. These constants have have now been defined as macros so that their corresponding
                environment companion functions (EnvFalseSymbol and EnvTrueSymbol) could be defined. See the
                <i>Advanced Programming Guide</i> for more details.</li>

                errors.</li>

                arguments before being passed to the target function of the funcall. The expand$ function can be placed
                around an argument to revert to the old behavior.</li>

                <li>Numerous fixes for functions and macros that did not accept the correct number of arguments as
                specified in the <i>Advanced Programming Guide</i>. The following functions and macros were corrected:
                Agenda, BatchStar, EnvGetActivationSalience, EnvBatchStar, EnvFactDeftemplate, EnvFactExistp,
                EnvFactList, EnvFactSlotNames, EnvGetNextInstanceInClassAndSubclasses, EnvLoadInstancesFromString,

            <ul>
                <li>Prior bug fix to the PutFactSlot C function prevented memory associated with the fact to be garbage
                collected after the fact had been retracted. The original bug is now fixed through a new API which
                allows embedded programs to temporarily disable garbage collection. See section 1.4 of <i>The Advanced
                Programming Guide</i> for more details.</li>
